 ## Approach to debug this code
 Refer https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_debugging.asp
 JavaScript itself provide multiple ways to debug a code. 
 1. Via dialog box
 This is simplest approach. For example, if you want to inspect any value, you will add code in script whereever you want to display any value.
 This approach uses window.alert() API
 Refer: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp
 2. Via console log
 This is also simple. Please ensure to start console in browser before running the code in browser. For example, if you want to inspect any value, you will add code in script whereever you want to display any value.
 This uses console.log() API

 3. Via breakpoint
 This is advanced approach. Interestingly, browser do support inserting breakpoint. At this point, browser halts and ask your permission to proceed. 
 This uses debugger keyword in JavaScript
 In general, breakpoint allows to debug any issue faster. breakpoint allows for 
 - step-by-step debugging.
 - Provides advanced debugging tools like watch, callstack etc.
